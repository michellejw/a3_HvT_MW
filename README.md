## Interactive World Ocean Atlas

For this project, we developed an interactive visualization using data from the [World Ocean Atlas 2013](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa13/woa13data.html) dataset. We show two main panels: one is a global map of surface temperature or salinity (the user can choose which one they'd like to view). Clicking on the map brings up the temperature and salinity profiles corresponding to that location in the other panel. 


## Running Instructions

Access our visualization at http://cse512-16s.github.io/a3-michellejw-hmvantol/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.

## Story Board

### Data domain
Since we are both Oceanography graduate students, we decided to go with an ocean-related dataset: the [World Ocean Atlas 2013 (WOA 2013)](http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa13/woa13data.html). There are a number of simple variables that are often used by oceanographers to study the movements of different water masses. Some of those variables include temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. The datasets provided through the WOA website are available as gridded files for each type of measurement. At each gridded location, the files contain a measurement "profile", which is a series of values interpolated to pre-defined depth bins. Oceanographers often look at measurements as a function of depth to understand the vertical stratification throughout the water column at a particular location. We will begin our visualization using one-degree gridded annual temperature, averaged between 2005-2012.

Oceanographers regularly explore large multi-variable data sets in 4D space (longitude, latitude, depth, time). Common visualizations include [contour maps](http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/ocean/sst/contour/), [depth profiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocline#/media/File:THERMOCLINE.png), and [T-S diagrams](https://oceanpython.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/ts_diagram.png). On research cruises, oceanographers will interact with data as it is being collected to make decisions about where to sample along the cruise track and at which depths. Data exploration could be supported by linking multiple commonly used visualizations, allowing the user to observe multiple dimensions at once.

Here is our first idea:
![Sketch 1](sketch1.jpg){height="1632px" width="1224px"}

This is a sketch of the type of map we are envisioning (though for now, note that coordinates are not labeled correctly and the default image color map could probably be better).
